# Project Context

- **Owner:** Zack Way
- **Project:** AI Policy Engine — APIM Policy Engine management UI for AI workloads, implementing AAA (Authentication, Authorization, Accounting) for API management. Built for teams who need bill-back reporting, runover tracking, token utilization, and audit capabilities. Telecom/RADIUS heritage.
- **Stack:** .NET 9 API (Chargeback.Api) with Aspire orchestration (Chargeback.AppHost), React frontend (chargeback-ui), Azure Managed Redis (caching), CosmosDB (long-term trace/audit storage), Azure API Management (policy enforcement), Bicep (infrastructure)
- **Created:** 2026-03-31

## Key Files

- `src/chargeback-ui/` — React frontend (my primary workspace)
- `src/chargeback-ui/package.json` — Frontend dependencies

## Learnings

*Core learnings consolidated in Core Context section above (see git history for detailed entries).*
- 2026-05-21: The `/apis` page render loop came from `loadInitialData` depending on `operationsByApi` while also resetting that state to a fresh `{}`, which changed the callback identity and re-fired the mount effect forever.
- Rule: if an effect triggers a callback that mutates local maps/arrays, keep the callback keyed to stable inputs and read the latest collection through a ref or stable ID instead of adding the collection itself to the callback deps.

## Archived Learnings (Pre-May 2026)

All development work from Phase 0–3 (2026-03-31 to 2026-05-14) is documented in Core Context and git commit history. Key achievements:
- Phase 0: Cosmos + Redis storage architecture
- Phase 1: Model routing policies + multiplier billing
- Phase 2: Agent365 Observability integration
- Phase 3: APIM policy variants and infrastructure
- Infrastructure: Terraform + azd deployment (77 resources)

## 2026-05-21 — APIs management UI (M4)

- Added APIM UI under `src/aipolicyengine-ui/src/pages/Apis.tsx` with dedicated client/types files in `src/api/apim.ts` and `src/types/apim.ts`; keep APIM shapes separate from legacy dashboard DTOs.
- For list/detail admin pages, the current pattern is Tailwind + local state: left tree/list in a `Card`, right details/actions in a second `Card`, dialogs for destructive/assignment flows, and inline fixed-position toast messaging for retryable network failures.
- APIM status polling is UI-driven: after a 202 apply response, set optimistic `applying` state and poll `GET .../policy` every 2 seconds until status leaves `pending`/`applying`.
- Template parameter defaults should prefer the current assignment, then template defaults, and only shared plan-level values; there is no contract yet to map a specific plan to an API assignment, so avoid guessing per-plan defaults.
- The SPA now maps top-level tabs to pathname routes in `App.tsx` (including `/apis`) without adding a router dependency; keep using this lightweight history API pattern unless the app adopts React Router later.

## 2026-05-21 — ASP.NET Core Nested Configuration Convention (FYI)

**Informational Context for Future Backend Config**

Freamon fixed a config-binding bug in the APIM infrastructure: the env var `APIM_RESOURCE_ID` does not bind to nested config keys in ASP.NET Core. The standard convention is **double underscore**: `Apim__ResourceId`.

**Pattern for Reference:**
- C# class `ApimManagementOptions` bound to section `"Apim"`
- Config key in code: `Apim:ResourceId` (colon)
- Environment variable: `Apim__ResourceId` (double underscore)

**If Frontend Consumes Similar Config Later:**
- Backend will emit env vars using this convention (e.g., `Foo__Bar__Baz` for nested settings)
- When frontend reads backend config, expect the same pattern
- This is idiomatic ASP.NET Core, not a special case

**Full decision merged into `.squad/decisions.md`.**

## 2026-05-22 — Flex+Truncate Pattern for Badge/Title Rows

**Layout Bug Fix Session:**
- Fixed text overflow in API tree rows and modal parameter cards
- Pattern: when a title and badge(s) share a flex row, the title needs `min-w-0 flex-1 truncate` and badges need `flex-shrink-0`
- Without `min-w-0`, flex items won't shrink below intrinsic content width, causing overflow
- Removed redundant `serviceUrl` from API tree (path is sufficient, URL cluttered the row)
- Simplified operation rows: show method badge + urlTemplate instead of duplicated `displayName` + verb + badge
- Modal horizontal scroll fixed with `overflow-x-hidden` on dialog container
- Parameter card grid changed from `md:grid-cols-2` to `sm:grid-cols-2` for narrower modal viewport fit

**Rule:** For any flex row with text + badges: `<span class="min-w-0 flex-1 truncate">Text</span><Badge class="flex-shrink-0">Label</Badge>`

## 2026-05-21 — AAA M6 UI Pending (Access Profile Admin Page)

**Status:** Pending — awaiting M3 precheck contract finalization

**Scope:** Build `/access` page (new admin UI for Access Profiles)

**Layout & Components:**
- **Top:** Client selector (dropdown/search from existing `GET /api/clients`)
- **Main grid:** APIs (rows) with columns: Plan, Routing Policy, Deployments allowed, Enable toggle
- **Drill-down:** Click API row to expand operations with per-operation overrides
- **Add/Edit form:** Select Plan (dropdown from existing plans), optionally select Routing Policy, optionally restrict deployments
- **Bulk action:** "Apply to multiple APIs" — select APIs from checklist, assign same profile to all in one shot

**Reuse:** Plan selector dropdown (already built for client assignment), Routing Policy selector (already built for Plans page)

**Client First Workflow:** Primary user journey is "configure THIS client's access to various APIs" — not "which clients use this API". So the layout starts with client selector, then shows their API matrix.

**Integration:** POST/PUT/DELETE via `/api/access-profiles/*` (Freamon M2). Trigger profile creation when form submits.

**Validation:** Contract awaits M3 precheck integration (apiId/operationId handling) and M4 log-ingest (audit trail).

**Next:** Start after M2 API contracts firm (2-3 days out).
